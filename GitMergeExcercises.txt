Git Merge Excercises
--------------------
Perform three different tests
Part 1: Fast Forward Merge Test
In this excercise, create a new branch (ffmtest), make few changes to this file. 
Add one more file. 
Finally merge the changes to main. Make sure main branch does not change or have new commits before merging the new branch.
